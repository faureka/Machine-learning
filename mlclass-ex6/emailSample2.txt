Assalamualaikum.

Your e-mail address came up in a random draw conducted by our Private law
firm, MOHAMAD BIN AZRI Law Chambers in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia. My name is
MOHAMAD BIN AZRI (Esq). A personal attorney to our late client Eng. USMAN
RASHEED who worked for an oil firm in Malaysia, Eng. USMAN RASHEED a well
known Philanthropist, before he died, he made a Will in our law firm
stating that $6M (Six million U.S. dollars only) should be donated to any
Philanthropist of our choice overseas.

We have made a random draw and your name and e-mail address was picked as
the beneficiary to this Will. I am particularly interested in securing
this money from the Bank, because they have issued a notice instructing us
to produce the beneficiary of this Will within 14 working days which
happens to be you or else the money will be credited to the Government
treasury as per law here.

It is my utmost desire to execute the Will of our late client. You are
required to get in contact with me immediately to start the process of
transferring this money to any of your designated official account. I urge
you to contact me immediately for further details bearing in mind that the
Bank has given us a date limit. Please contact me urgently via telephone
or email: mohamad_azri@aim.com


CONGRATULATIONS
Regards,
BARRISTER MOHAMAD BIN AZRI [Esq]
